# weather-app

## About
A college project of mine from third year. It is a weather app which runs on Android. It is built in Java and styling is done with XML.

## Usage
The user can add cities of their choice based on their ID. The main page displays the current weather conditions of the city. Additionally, the user can view the forecast of the whole week for the selected city. Added cities can be deleted at any time.
